# Memvid

The memory layer for AI agents.

Memvid gives AI systems photographic memory in a single portable file.  
It replaces complex RAG pipelines with a serverless, offline-capable memory format designed for fast retrieval and long-term persistence.

## What Memvid Provides

- A single `.mv2` file that stores, indexes, and retrieves knowledge
- Hybrid lexical and semantic search
- Low-latency queries suitable for agent loops
- Crash-safe persistence with write-ahead logging
- No external databases or cloud dependencies
- CLI, Python, and Node.js support

## Use Cases

- Long-term memory for AI agents
- RAG applications without infrastructure overhead
- Knowledge bases and document search
- Local-first and privacy-sensitive AI systems
